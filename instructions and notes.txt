all classes should be in different files in src/scripts

first file that gets run is index.js (that's the only file that webpack looks for)

whenever you have a callback (e.g. addEventListener, setTimeout, setInterval), it loses context. you need to bind it.
    - get used to binding functions in instructor (this will become important in react)


scss gives us some more power (e.g. you can create variable names)
    - those go in src/styles


webpack ONLY pulls from index files (e.g. index.js, index.scss, index.html). In your index files, you should be importing classes, etc from other files in the /scripts and /styles folders.
    - what webpack does is create "main.js" and "main.css" files in /dist

'npm run build' adds main.css.map and main.js.map to /dist
    - go to github repo>settings>pages, change Branch to main and save

BRANCHES
git checkout -b <whatever you're working on>
    - the dash b adds a new branch (omit -b if just switching branches)
now, after add and commit,
    - git push origin <branch_name>
once ready to merge:
    - git checking main
    - git merge <branch_name>
    - if any issues with merging, call the PM
    - you cannot change branches without committing

$color: purple; // (define here so if you have one color used a bunch of places, you don't have to change it everywhere, you can just change it once)

#main>h1 {
    border: 4px solid $color;
    padding: 20px;
}

//without adding it in index.scss, this doesn't do anything. you need to import styling into index.scss
